"""Integration tests for skip detection pipeline end-to-end.

These tests exercise the full three-tier skip detection algorithm:
1. O(1) generation check
2. O(n) lock file comparison
3. Run cache lookup

Unlike unit tests that mock internals, these tests use the actual execute_stage()
function and simulate coordinator behavior (applying deferred writes) between runs.
